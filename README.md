# Purpose
To collect and present useful URLs for information security work and research. It is an alternative to keeping bookmarks in individual browsers on individual devices, or trying to sync browsers across multiple devices manually or through the use of online accounts.

# Philosophy
The idea of this project, as with any resource project that I'm working on, is to provide a lot of information that is easily searchable. 

## The URLs
Any URL presented in the [[Index]] should be useful enough to find based a specific use case (using tagging or keyword searching).

## The Information at the URLs
The information provided by the linked resources should be useful enough to cover a wide range of use cases based on the general use case presented in the [[Index]]. That is to say, if the [[Index]] presents a URL for the python language, the website referenced should provide more specific information about python that can be used for a wide range of purposes/use cases.

## Indexing
Tags should be limited to those presented in the [[Tag Index]]. This is prevent a sort of *ad hoc* tagging strategy that could become a problem over time. Presently, the addition of tags to the [[Tag Index]] is a judgment call by the user in the hopes that over time, with increased usage of this resource, a better strategy can start to become employed.

The [[Tag Index]] itself also provides a cross-referencing capability to aid in starting a search. That is, if a specific topic needs to be searched, the [[Tag Index]] provides a place to start to find tags that would be relevant to the topic at hand.

Secondarily, the [[Tag Index]] can also aid the user in finding tags that might be abbreviated for the sake of space, as well as maintain control over tags that **could** be abbreviated, thus creating the searching nightmare of "are all the **AD** tags also tagged as **ActiveDirectory**? What about vice versa?"
