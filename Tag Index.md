## Reference tag
Use for sites that explicitly lay out principles of a subject, rather than walkthroughs of specific use cases. An exemption to this principle might be if a resource (website, page, etc) provides examples to clarify concepts presented.

## A Word About Related Tags
Recently I've noticed that at times I have trouble deciding on certain tags for some resources. For instance, when tagging a resource as ActiveDirectory, I have trouble deciding if I should use the Windows tag also. My current thought on that specific case is that I should be using the Windows tag for resources that are specifically related to the Windows OS. Overall my thought is that in whatever case, I need to make a decision about how I distinguish between related tags, and somehow relate that information, perhaps to this document. I think I'll try that and see how it goes, then reevaluate if the task becomes too tiresome or the situation gets out of hand (e.g. I start making *ad hoc* decisions that subsequently fail to be documented).
